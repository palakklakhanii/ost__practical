DEFINE ALKANES AND EXPLAIN ISOMERISM IN ALKANES= 1.Alkanes are saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons having strong carbon-carbon single bond.
2. Alkanes are known as paraffins as they are less reactive due to strong carbon-carbon covalent bond.
3. The general formula for alkanes is RnH2n+2.
4. Isomerism is the phenomena in which molecules have similar molecular formula but different structural formula.
5. examples: C4H10
